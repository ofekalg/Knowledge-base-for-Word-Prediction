# AWS Big Data Project

This project was given to me as an assignment as part of a course during my bechelor dgree.
In the course we used AWS and Hadoop to work with large amount of data. We learned the basics and the importance of ML.

In this assignment we generated a knowledge-base for Hebrew word-prediction system, based on Google 3-Gram Hebrew dataset, using Amazon Elastic Map-Reduce (EMR) and Hadoop. The produced knowledge-base indicates the probability of each word trigram found in the corpus.

In this assignment, we implemented a held out method, named deleted estimation.
